## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in DataScrapexter, please follow these steps:

### üîí Private Disclosure Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability
2. Send an email to `security@datascrapexter.com` (if available) or create a private security advisory
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours of report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates until resolution
- **Fix Release**: Target within 90 days for critical issues

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

DataScrapexter implements several security measures to protect users and target websites:

#### Input Validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database identifiers are validated against strict patterns
- **Configuration Validation**: YAML configurations are thoroughly validated
- **URL Validation**: Target URLs are validated and sanitized
- **Selector Validation**: CSS/XPath selectors are validated for safety

#### Data Protection
- **Credentials**: No hardcoded credentials in source code
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Configuration Encryption**: Support for encrypted configuration files (planned)
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use

#### Network Security
- **TLS/SSL**: All HTTPS connections use secure TLS configurations
- **Proxy Validation**: Proxy configurations are validated for security
- **Certificate Verification**: TLS certificates are verified by default
- **Timeout Protection**: Network requests have appropriate timeouts

#### Access Control
- **File Permissions**: Strict file permission requirements
- **Database Access**: Principle of least privilege for database connections
- **API Authentication**: Secure authentication for API endpoints (when available)

### üö® Known Security Considerations

#### Web Scraping Ethics
- **robots.txt Compliance**: Built-in robots.txt parsing and respect
- **Rate Limiting**: Mandatory rate limiting to prevent server overload
- **User-Agent Identification**: Proper user-agent identification
- **Legal Compliance**: Tools for legal compliance checking

#### Data Handling
- **Personal Data**: Guidelines for handling personal data responsibly
- **Data Retention**: Configurable data retention policies
- **Export Controls**: Awareness of data export regulations

#### Anti-Detection Features
- **Responsible Use**: Anti-detection features should only be used ethically
- **Terms of Service**: Users must respect website terms of service
- **Legal Boundaries**: Stay within legal boundaries of web scraping

### üîß Security Configuration

#### Recommended Security Settings

```yaml
# Secure proxy configuration
proxy:
  tls:
    insecure_skip_verify: false  # Always verify certificates
    min_version: "1.2"           # Minimum TLS version

# Database security
database:
  connection_string: "${DATABASE_URL}"  # Use environment variables

# Rate limiting for protection
rate_limit:
  strategy: "adaptive"
  base_delay: "2s"
  max_delay: "30s"

# Compliance settings
compliance:
  respect_robots_txt: true
  gdpr_compliance: true
  user_agent_identification: true
```

#### Security Checklist

- [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- [ ] Enable TLS certificate verification
- [ ] Set appropriate rate limits
- [ ] Respect robots.txt files
- [ ] Use secure database connections
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies
- [ ] Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Use least privilege access patterns

### üîç Security Auditing

#### Regular Security Practices
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Static Analysis**: Automated static code analysis
- **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security assessments
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews

#### Tools Used
- `go mod audit` for dependency vulnerabilities
- `gosec` for static security analysis
- `golangci-lint` with security linters enabled
- Manual security code reviews
