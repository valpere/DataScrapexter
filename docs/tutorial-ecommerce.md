# Tutorial: Building an E-commerce Price Monitor with DataScrapexter

## Introduction

This comprehensive tutorial demonstrates how to build a professional e-commerce price monitoring system using DataScrapexter. We will create scrapers that extract product information including prices, availability, specifications, and other critical data from online stores. This real-world example showcases DataScrapexter's capabilities in handling complex website structures and implementing robust data transformation pipelines.

The tutorial addresses key aspects of e-commerce scraping including configuration design for product catalogs and detail pages, handling pagination across multiple product listings, extracting and normalizing price data, managing product variants and specifications, implementing comprehensive error handling, and organizing output for analysis and tracking. By completing this tutorial, you will have a fully functional price monitoring system adaptable to various e-commerce platforms.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this tutorial, ensure you have DataScrapexter installed and verified according to the installation guide. Familiarity with YAML syntax will help in understanding configuration files. Basic command-line knowledge is required for running DataScrapexter commands. A text editor suitable for editing YAML files is necessary, and understanding of CSS selectors will be beneficial for creating extraction rules.

## Project Structure

Begin by establishing a well-organized project structure that facilitates maintenance and scalability:

```bash
mkdir price-monitor
cd price-monitor
mkdir configs outputs logs scripts data
```

This structure provides dedicated directories for different aspects of your price monitoring system. The configs directory stores YAML configuration files, outputs contains scraped data, logs maintains operational records, scripts holds automation and processing scripts, and data stores processed or analyzed information.

## Understanding E-commerce Website Patterns

E-commerce websites typically follow predictable structural patterns that we can leverage for efficient data extraction. Product listing pages display multiple items with basic information such as names, prices, thumbnails, and availability indicators. Individual product pages contain comprehensive details including full descriptions, technical specifications, multiple images, customer reviews, and shipping information. Category structures organize products hierarchically with consistent navigation patterns.

Most e-commerce platforms implement various anti-scraping measures to protect their infrastructure and data. Common protections include rate limiting to prevent rapid request sequences, dynamic content loading through JavaScript frameworks, session management requiring proper cookie handling, and bot detection systems analyzing request patterns. DataScrapexter addresses these challenges through built-in features including intelligent rate limiting, user agent rotation, session persistence, and request pattern randomization.

## Creating the Product Listing Configuration

We begin by creating a configuration file for extracting product information from category pages. Create the file `configs/products-listing.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "electronics_category_scraper"
base_url: "https://example-shop.com/category/electronics"

# Respectful scraping settings

  file: "outputs/product-details.json"
```

## Executing the Scraping Process

### Step 1: Configuration Validation

Before executing the scrapers, validate both configuration files to ensure correctness:

```bash
datascrapexter validate configs/products-listing.yaml
datascrapexter validate configs/product-details.yaml
```

Successful validation confirms that your configurations are properly formatted and contain all required fields.

### Step 2: Scraping Product Listings

Execute the listing scraper to collect product overview data:

```bash
datascrapexter run configs/products-listing.yaml
```

This operation creates a CSV file containing all products from the specified category, including prices, availability, and basic metrics.

### Step 3: Processing Product URLs

Extract individual product URLs from the listing results for detailed scraping:

```bash
# Extract URLs from CSV (assuming URLs are in the second column)
tail -n +2 outputs/products-listing.csv | cut -d',' -f2 > outputs/product-urls.txt
```

### Step 4: Detailed Product Scraping

Create a script to systematically scrape individual products:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: scripts/scrape-products.sh

while IFS= read -r url; do
    echo "Processing: $url"
    filename=$(basename "$url" | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/_/g')

    PRODUCT_URL="$url" datascrapexter run configs/product-details.yaml \
        -o "outputs/products/${filename}.json"

    # Respectful delay between products
    sleep 2
done < outputs/product-urls.txt
```

## Advanced Configuration Strategies

### Managing Dynamic Pricing

E-commerce platforms often display context-dependent pricing. Enhance your configuration to capture these variations:

```yaml
fields:
  - name: "regular_price"
    selector: ".price-regular"
    type: "text"
    transform:
      - type: "clean_price"
      - type: "parse_float"

  - name: "member_price"
    selector: ".price-member"
    type: "text"
    transform:
      - type: "clean_price"
      - type: "parse_float"

  - name: "bulk_price"
    selector: ".price-bulk"
    type: "text"
    transform:
      - type: "clean_price"
      - type: "parse_float"

  - name: "price_conditions"
    selector: ".price-condition"
    type: "list"
    transform:
      - type: "trim"
```

### Extracting Product Variants

Products often have multiple variants requiring specialized extraction:

```yaml
fields:
  - name: "color_options"
    selector: ".color-swatches .swatch"
    type: "list"
    attribute: "data-color"

  - name: "size_options"
    selector: ".size-selector option"
    type: "list"
    transform:
      - type: "trim"

  - name: "variant_skus"
    selector: ".variant-option"
    type: "list"
    attribute: "data-sku"
```

## Data Processing and Analysis

### Combining Multiple Data Sources

After scraping, consolidate data from various sources using Python:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# File: scripts/combine_data.py

import json
import csv
import glob
from datetime import datetime

def combine_product_data():
    # Load listing data
    products = {}
    with open('outputs/products-listing.csv', 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        for row in reader:
            url = row.get('product_urls', '')
            products[url] = {
                'listing_data': row,
                'scraped_at': datetime.now().isoformat()
            }

    # Merge with detailed data
    for json_file in glob.glob('outputs/products/*.json'):
        with open(json_file, 'r') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            if data and len(data) > 0:
                detail = data[0]
                url = detail.get('url', '')
                if url in products:
                    products[url]['detail_data'] = detail.get('data', {})

    # Save combined data
    with open('data/combined_products.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(list(products.values()), f, indent=2)

    print(f"Combined {len(products)} products")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    combine_product_data()
```

### Implementing Price Tracking

Track price changes over time by scheduling regular scraping:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: scripts/track_prices.sh

DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
OUTPUT_DIR="outputs/tracking/${DATE}"

mkdir -p "${OUTPUT_DIR}"

# Run scraper with timestamped output
datascrapexter run configs/products-listing.yaml \
    -o "${OUTPUT_DIR}/products-listing.csv"

# Archive for historical analysis
cp "${OUTPUT_DIR}/products-listing.csv" \
   "data/price_history/listing_${DATE}.csv"

# Generate price change report
python scripts/analyze_price_changes.py
```

### Price Change Analysis

Implement analysis to identify significant price movements:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# File: scripts/analyze_price_changes.py

import pandas as pd
import glob
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def analyze_price_changes():
    # Load latest two price snapshots
    files = sorted(glob.glob('data/price_history/listing_*.csv'))

    if len(files) < 2:
        print("Insufficient data for comparison")
        return

    current = pd.read_csv(files[-1])
    previous = pd.read_csv(files[-2])

    # Merge on product URL
    merged = current.merge(
        previous,
        on='product_urls',
        suffixes=('_current', '_previous')
    )

    # Calculate price changes
    merged['price_change'] = merged['prices_current'] - merged['prices_previous']
    merged['price_change_pct'] = (merged['price_change'] / merged['prices_previous']) * 100

    # Identify significant changes
    significant = merged[abs(merged['price_change_pct']) > 5]

    # Generate report
    with open('outputs/price_changes_report.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write(f"Price Change Analysis - {datetime.now()}\n")
        f.write("=" * 50 + "\n\n")

        f.write(f"Total products analyzed: {len(merged)}\n")
        f.write(f"Products with >5% change: {len(significant)}\n\n")

        for _, row in significant.iterrows():
            f.write(f"Product: {row['product_names_current']}\n")
            f.write(f"Previous: ${row['prices_previous']:.2f}\n")
            f.write(f"Current: ${row['prices_current']:.2f}\n")
            f.write(f"Change: {row['price_change_pct']:.1f}%\n")
            f.write("-" * 30 + "\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyze_price_changes()
```

## Error Handling and Monitoring

### Implementing Robust Error Recovery

Enhance your configurations with multiple selector fallbacks:

```yaml
fields:
  - name: "price"
    selector: ".price-now, .current-price, .product-price, [itemprop='price']"
    type: "text"
    required: true
    transform:
      - type: "clean_price"
      - type: "parse_float"
```

### Creating a Monitoring System

Develop a comprehensive monitoring script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: scripts/monitor_health.sh

LOG_FILE="logs/monitor_$(date +%Y%m%d).log"

echo "=== Scraper Health Check - $(date) ===" >> "$LOG_FILE"

# Check recent file updates
RECENT_FILES=$(find outputs -name "*.csv" -mtime -1 | wc -l)
echo "Files updated in last 24 hours: $RECENT_FILES" >> "$LOG_FILE"

if [ $RECENT_FILES -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "WARNING: No recent updates detected" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    # Send alert notification
fi

# Validate data quality
MIN_PRODUCTS=50
if [ -f "outputs/products-listing.csv" ]; then
    PRODUCT_COUNT=$(wc -l < outputs/products-listing.csv)
    echo "Products in latest scrape: $PRODUCT_COUNT" >> "$LOG_FILE"

    if [ $PRODUCT_COUNT -lt $MIN_PRODUCTS ]; then
        echo "WARNING: Low product count" >> "$LOG_FILE"
    fi
fi

# Check for errors in logs
ERROR_COUNT=$(grep -c "ERROR" logs/datascrapexter*.log 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
echo "Errors in recent logs: $ERROR_COUNT" >> "$LOG_FILE"

# Disk space check
DISK_USAGE=$(df -h outputs | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}')
echo "Output directory disk usage: $DISK_USAGE" >> "$LOG_FILE"
```

### Automated Scheduling

Configure automated execution using cron:

```bash
# Add to crontab
# Run listing scraper daily at 6 AM
0 6 * * * cd /path/to/price-monitor && ./scripts/daily_scrape.sh

# Run detailed scraper for new products every 4 hours
0 */4 * * * cd /path/to/price-monitor && ./scripts/scrape_new_products.sh

# Generate reports weekly
0 9 * * 1 cd /path/to/price-monitor && ./scripts/generate_weekly_report.sh

# Health monitoring every hour
0 * * * * cd /path/to/price-monitor && ./scripts/monitor_health.sh
```
